# FormToEmail
Need a php file to send the order form to the email of the person who owns the business. This file needs the $to, $subject, $message, and $header for the mail() function. I have a second mail() function that sends a confirmation email to the person who submitted the order. 

# What I Learned  
- I learned how to construct a full message for the email
- I leaned how to use the header function to go send the user to the next page of the website after submitting the order.
